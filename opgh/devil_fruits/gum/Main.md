# Pros

The user of this fruit is bestowed the properties of "Rubber" making him a rubber human.
Physical blunt attacks along with bullets do not damage users with this fruit.

Has a decent amount of range due to the elasticity of the fruit, and can be a deadly combination when
mixed with Buso.

# Cons

Can be easily sliced with sword and other sharp related abilities.

No passive logia effect due to it being a Paramecia.
